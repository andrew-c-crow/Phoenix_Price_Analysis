# Phoenix_Price_Analysis

Analyzing historical sales data from Phoenix Skin Care, a men’s skincare brand established in 2020, this project aims to determine optimal pricing strategies for maximum profitability. Despite extensive reporting available through Amazon, specific insights regarding how varied pricing impacts overall sales volume and revenue remain unexplored. This study addresses this gap by analyzing three years of order data for multiple skincare products within the U.S. market, primarily utilizing polynomial regression adjusted for seasonality. Early exploratory analysis indicated unexpected non-linear relationships between product pricing and sales volume, prompting the choice of a polynomial regression model that accounts for seasonality to accurately capture these dynamics. Alternative approaches, such as price elasticity and time series forecasting methods, were considered but found to be less suitable due to data constraints and the project's scope. The central hypothesis posits a significant relationship between product pricing and revenue generation across Phoenix Skin Care’s product lines. The findings will offer actionable insights, assisting the company in refining pricing to achieve sustained profit maximization.
